# APK Static Scan

This repository contains Python scripts for static analysis of Android APK files to detect potential sensitive information leakage

## Usage

### full_static_scan.py

This script decompiles APK files and scans the decompiled Java source code for analysis

1. Place all APK files you want to analyze in a target directory.
2. Set a directory to store the findings text files.

Run the script using the following command:

```sh
python3 full_static_scan.py <apk_directory>
```

### sensitive_finding.py
This script scans the text files generated by full_static_scan.py for sensitive information patterns.

Set the target directory to where all the text files are stored.

Run the script using the following command:

```sh
python3 sensitive_finding.py
```

## How It Works
Decompiles APKs: Uses jadx to decompile APK files into Java source code.

Searches for Patterns: Scans Java methods for predefined patterns indicating HTTP connections and sensitive data handling.

Generates Reports: Outputs findings to text files for further review.

## Requirements
**Python 3.x**

**jadx** (must be installed and available in the system PATH)
